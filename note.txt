Midterm review WAP notes
Lesson - 1
1. Introduction to Web Programming
  - Internet is a globally connected computer network while Web is a service that provides web pages on that network.
  1. The internet is the global network of connected computers, while the world wide web is only one service one that network (the 
  service that provides web pages). The internet is a network of connected computers.
  1.1 The internet is a global computer network that uses the IP protocol to uniquely identify computers on the network. Through the 
  TCP protocol each IP address can work with multiple services at the same time. One of these services is the HTTP protocol which is 
  used by the World Wide Web to transport HTML pages. 
 2. Structure of a Page
  - semantic elements = no outward appearance
3. Types of Text
  - Block vs Inline Elements
  ● Block elements contain an entire large region of content
  – Examples: paragraphs, lists, table cells
  – The browser places a margin of whitespace between block elements
  for separation, normally a newline
  ● Inline elements affect a small amount of content
  – Examples: bold text, code fragments, images
  – The browser allows many inline elements to appear on the same line
  – Must be nested inside a block element
4. Lists and Tables
  - <ul>
     <li>No shoes</li>
     <li>No shirt</li>
    </ul>
  ul - unordered list(*), ol - ordered list(number), li - list item
  - Important: nested lists are inside list items. Not directly inside the other list!
  - Definition Lists <dl> <dt> <dd>
  <dl>
   <dt>newbie</dt>
   <dd>one who does not have mad skills</dd>
   <dt>own</dt>
   <dd>to soundly defeat</dd>
  </dl>
  - difinition list - dl, difinition tag - dt, difinition data - dd
  - HTML Tables <table> <tr> <td>
    <table>
     <caption>My important data</caption>
     <tr>
     <td>1,1</td>
     <td>1,2 okay</td>
    </tr>
    tr - table row, td - table data, th - table header
   - colspan makes a cell occupy multiple columns - colspan="2"
   - rowspan makes a cell occupy multiple rows - rowspan="3"
 Main point:
 1. HTML is the basis of web programming, every web page is composed of HTML. 
 2. HTTP - The protocol consists of a set of commands that a computer can send to a server to request files
      - GET: Requests a specific file or resource from the server 
      - POST: Submits form information to the server (not idempotent) 
      - PUT: Uploads a file to the server (.  idempotent) 
      - HEAD: Requests information about a file from the server, but not the file’s entire contents.
    TCP - multiplexing, guaranteed message delivery on top of IP(IP is individual computer address)
    DNS - A set of servers that map written names to IP addresses(www.cs.miu.edu → 192.103.45.104)
Lesson 2
 1. Basic CSS
  - selector {
     property: value; ...
    }
  text-align alignment of text within its element left, center, right, justify
  text-decoration decorations such as underlining underline, overline, linethrough, blink, none
  text-indent Indent first line a size(px, pt, %, em)
  line-height vertical size of each line a size(px, pt, %, em)
  letter-spacing Horizontal gap between letters a size(px, pt, %, em)
  word-spacing Horizontal gap between words a size(px, pt, %, em)
  text-overflow How to handle too-long text clip, ellipsis, ellipsis-word
  text-shadow A “drop shadow” next to text Two distances(px, pt, %, em) plus an optional shadow color
  CSS properties for text
  h2 {
   /* also overline, line-through, blink, or none. Effects can be combined */
   text-decoration: underline overline;
   /* Shadow is specified as X-offset, Y-offset, and optional color */
   text-shadow: -2px 5px gray;
  }
  p {
   /* Alignment of text within its element, left, right, center, or justify */
   text-align: center;
   /* Space between the lines in two paragraphs */
   line-height: 30px;
   /* Space between words in <p> elements should be 30 pixels */
   word-spacing: 30px;
   /* Indent the first line of all <p> elements with 50 pixels */
   text-indent: 50px;
  }
  CSS properties for background
  background-color color to fill background A color
  background-image image to place in background url(image URL)
  background-position placement of bg image within element Two tokens for x/y as top, bottom, left, right, center, or a size(pt, px, %, em)
  background-repeat whether/how bg image should be repeated repeat(default), repeat-x, repeat-y or no-repeat
  backgroundattachment whether bg image scrolls with page scroll(default), fixed
  background-size scaling of bg image a size(pt, px, %, em), cover, or contain
  background shorthand to set all background properties
  Background
  body {
  /* image to place in background */
  background-image: url("../images/draft.jpg");
  /* How bg image should be repeated */
  /* repeat (default), repeat-x, repeat-y, or no-repeat */
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
  /* placement of bg image within element. two tokens, can
  be top, left, right, bottom, center, a percentage, or
  a length value in px, pt, etc */
  background-position: 370px 20px;
  }
  The list-style-type property
  •none : No marker
  •disc (default), circle, square
  •decimal : 1, 2, 3, etc.
  •decimal-leading-zero : 01, 02, 03, etc.
  •lower-roman : i, ii, iii, iv, v, etc.
  •upper-roman : I, II, III, IV, V, etc.
  •lower-alpha : a, b, c, d, e, etc.
  •upper-alpha : A, B, C, D, E, etc.
  •lower-greek : alpha, beta, gamma, etc.
  ol { list-style-type: lower-roman;}
 2. CSS Levels
   - More specific styles overwrite more general styles in css levels.
   - Styles get inherited from containing elements
   - •It’s a good practice to reset some body values before we start coding our own CSS rules: body { margin: 0 }
   - when two styles set conflicting values for the same property, the latter style takes precedence
   - • Inheritance is how elements in the HTML markup inherit properties from their parent elements
     • cascade is how different CSS rule sets are applied to HTML elements, and how conflicting rules do or don’t override each other.
   - Style Specificity - The most specific one applies 
   - pseudo - p:hover {color: green} // don't exist in DOM :hover not exist. // class :, element ::
     • Style the first letter, or line, of an element
     • ::first-line, ::first-letter
     • Insert content (pseudo element) before, or after, the content of an element
     • ::before, ::after
     :active an activated or selected element
     :focus an element that has the keyboard focus
     :hover an element that has the mouse over it
     :link a link that has not been visited
     :visited a link that has already been visited
     :nth-child(expr)
     :first-child, :last-child targets specific children of a given element
     :not(selector) all elements that do not match the given CSS selector
     ::first-line the first line of text inside an element
     ::first-letter the first letter of text inside an element
     /* unvisited link */
     a:link { color: #FF0000; }
     /* visited link */
     a:visited { color: #00FF00; }
     /* mouse over link */
     a:hover { color: #FF00FF; }
     /* click on a link */
     a:active { color: #0000FF; }
     selector1 selector2 only in selector1
     selector1 > selector2 direct child
   - Cascading in CSS indicates that there are multiple levels of style sheets. More specific styles overwrite more general styles
 3. Styling Section - The tag provides a generic block level element that can be used for any division or section of your page. The tag 
  provides a generic inline element for specifying any range of text inside a box. By using these tags, combined with CSS selectors we 
  can write powerful and reusable CSS rules to style and layout pages. - We can use semantic element instead div. in html 5
  Main point:
   1. How a page is displayed is affected by both the HTML and the CSS 
   2. Although every HTML tag has a default way of displaying, it can easily be changed with CSS and should never be the basis for 
      using it. Instead use HTML tags based on meaning.
Lesson 3
 1. The Box Model
    - box-sizing: content-box; - initial and default value. The width and height properties
      are measured including only the content, but not the padding, border or margin.
     •box-sizing: border-box; The width and height properties include the content, the
      padding and border, but not the margin. Note that padding and border will be inside of the box
     border-radius: 12px;
    - ● The box model is a description of how every element has a basic width and height, outside of which it has padding, a
       border, and margin. For inline elements only the left and right margin and padding affect surrounding elements.
 2. Inline and Block
   - img {vertical-align: baseline; }
